<h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. With the increasing volume of online and electronic payments, financial institutions need reliable and real-time solutions to detect anomalies and prevent unauthorized activity. This model aims to support fraud prevention efforts by accurately classifying transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

Problem Statement:
Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to financial security, causing substantial losses to both institutions and customers. The challenge is to build a system that can distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions based on transaction patterns and customer behavior, often using highly imbalanced datasets where fraud cases are rare

Model Approach:
- </b>Dataset containing anonymized credit card transaction data with labeled outcomes (fraudulent or legitimate).</b>
- </b>Preprocessed the data by: aHandling class imbalance using techniques like undersampling, oversampling (SMOTE), or class weighting

Normalizing numerical features</b>

- </b>Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and outliers</b>

Built and tested  machine learning model: </b>
- </b>Logistic Regression Model</b>
- </b>Evaluated model performance </b>



<h2>Skills </h2>

- </b>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</b>
- </b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>
- </b>Logistic Regression Model</b>
- </b>Feature engineering</b>
- </b>Model evaluation and interpretation</b>

<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- </b>Successfully built a machine learning model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions with high precision and recall. The solution can be integrated into real-time monitoring systems to reduce financial fraud and enhance transaction security for users and institutions.</b>
